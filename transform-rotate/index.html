<!--
With no finger on the screen, trackpad move maps to translation.

Dragging the object with finger on screen moves it.

With a finger on the object, trackpad move maps to rotation around that fulcrum.
With a finger not on the object, trackpad move maps to rotating the whole canvas.

With a finger on the object, trackpad scroll (2 finger) maps to scale.
With a finger not on the object, trackpad scroll maps to zoom.

Multiple fingers on multiple objects should work as expected.
