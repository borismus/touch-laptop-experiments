<!--
A prototype UI that turns into one suited to touchscreens as soon as you touch
it, and back to a regular mouse UI as soon as you move the mouse.

Things that happen moving from mouse to touch:

- Increased touch target sizes.
- Remove reliance on hover.
- Add gesture support.
- (Look for more inspiration in Tablet apps vs. Desktop apps).
